\section{Conclusion}

    \item Developed a framework for producing compiler correctness proofs
      for languages with sharing constructs, given proofs which don't involve sharing.
           \item Gave a specific proof for an example language, as ``instance'' of this framework.

    \item Limitations encountered:
       \item Strictly positive types required
       \item Totality checker (when defining folds)
       \item Type checking with positivity check disabled made debugging hard (stack overflow, memory consumption).
         

    \subsection{Yet to be done}
        \item Sequence clause of ``basic'' (non-lifted) correctness proof
        \item Proof a final lemma to complete the lifting (fusion law)
