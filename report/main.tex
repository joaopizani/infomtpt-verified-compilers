    \section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:intro}
        In this report we describe our work for the final project of the master course
        "Theory of Programming and Types" at Utrecht University. Our research involves
        the question of compiler correctness, i.e, giving a \emph{specification} for
        a language (a semantics), and proving that a compiler for that language respects
        the given semantics.

        Concretely, our notion of correctness depends on two semantics, respectively for the source
        and object languages of the compiler. We define a denotational semantics (eval) for the source
        language, as well as an operational semantics (exec) for the target machine. Correctness
        states that evaluation is equal to compilation composed with execution.

        More specifically, we were interested in having \emph{machine-checked} proofs of correctness,
        i.e, proofs written in the language of an interactive proof assistant. Some initiatives in
        this direction are already being taken, most famously CompCert, a formally verified compiler
        for the C language, which had its proof written in the \emph{Coq} proof assistant.

        Our approach, besides using the \emph{Agda} programming language instead of emph{Coq},
        also differs from CompCert in that it uses dependent types as a way to make the
        source and object languages (as well as the compiler) have some meta-theoretical properties
        \emoh{by construction}, instead of proving them separately.

        Dependent types allow us to embed, as indices to the language definitions and in the type
        of the ``compile'' function, constraints which make these definitions correct. %%%

        % General motivations, etc.
        % Formalize correctness in terms of semantics
        % How dependent types help.

    \section{Goals/Contributions}
    \label{sec:goals}
        % Mention two papers we based our work on
        % Our wish to join the contributions of both papers
        % What adaptations we did to each approach to help them work together:
            % Extension in the Src to reveal "sharing opportunities"
            % Make functors and proofs of the lifting approach indexed

    \section{Basic correctness}
    \label{sec:basic}
        % Introduce compiler correctness in general (no models mentioned)
        % Talk about our model with sequencing and the "vector values"
        % Code for Src and Bytecode, and correctness proof

    \section{Lifiting to shared setting}
    \label{sec:lifiting}
        % What is the sharing opportunity (diagram, just Src code example)
        % A different representation of Bytecode (graph) that could capture sharing
            % Give example of a "BytecodeG" term...
        % If we make Bytecode into functor, we can have different representations by
        % applying fixed-point-like operators
          % Htree, HGraph (iso, not iso really)

        % State the "lifting" theorems
            % Grand finale: correctG
           

    \section{Conclusions}
    \label{sec:conclusions}
        % Summarize contributions (again?)

        % Points where we got stuck (holes, postulates)
            % Some possibilities of attempts, if we had more time

        % Difficulties encountered along the way
            % Ideas of why they happened
                % Tool-related (Agda)
                % Domain-related (problem inherently hard)
